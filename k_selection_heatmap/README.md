# What each file does

1. k_selection_heatmap.R generates simulated data, runs NMF, and saves the NMF results.
2. find_ks.R extracts the predicted number of clusters from the saved NMF results.
3. create_figures.R compiles this into the data behind the figures. This script does not actually generate the pictoral figures.
